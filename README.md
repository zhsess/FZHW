Longtan Wang, Yijian Zhou, Shiyong Zhou, Hao Zhang, Detection of fault zone head waves and the fault interface imaging in the Xianshuihe–Anninghe Fault zone (Eastern Tibetan Plateau), Geophysical Journal International, Volume 234, Issue 2, August 2023, Pages 1157–1167, https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad131
